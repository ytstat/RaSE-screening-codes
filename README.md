# Codes for RaSE screening paper
Codes to reproduce the results of numerical experiments in "Tian, Y. and Feng, Y., 2021. RaSE: A Variable Screening Framework via Random Subspace Ensembles. arXiv preprint arXiv:2102.03892." (version 2, updated on Apr 2021)

We also update R package "*RaSEn*", but the latest version (2.1.0) has not been uploaded to CRAN yet due to issues about too large data set. 
It can be installed from the source file we provide. We suggest install packages "*RaSEn*" (version 2.0.0) and "*KernelKnn*" from CRAN first, then 
run command 
```
install.packages("../RaSEn_2.1.0.tar.gz", type = "source", repos = NULL)
```
(replace .. with your own path) in R/RStudio to finish installation.
